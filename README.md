# Python.challenge
In this Python programming challenge we are dealing with two datasets PyBank and PyPoll.
# PyBank challenge:
This dataset is financial dataset called budget_data.csv(saved in Resources folder). The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses". The tasked given is to create a Python script that analyses the records to calculate each of the following values:
•	-**The total number of months included in the dataset.
•	-**The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
•	-**The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
•	-**The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
•	-**The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
I have created a python script to analyse the data and out/results are saved as result.txt in Analysis folder. 
# PyPoll challenge:
This dataset is for rural U.S. town modernise its vote-counting process. Dataset given is of poll data called election_data.csv (saved in Resources folder). The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". The tasked given is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:
•	-**The total number of votes cast
•	-**A complete list of candidates who received votes
•	-**The percentage of votes each candidate won
•	-**The total number of votes each candidate won
•	-**The winner of the election based on popular vote
I have created a python script to analyse the data and out/results are saved as result.txt in Analysis folder.
