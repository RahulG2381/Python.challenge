# Python Programming Challenges

## PyBank Challenge

In the PyBank challenge, we work with a financial dataset named `budget_data.csv` (saved in the Resources folder). The dataset consists of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses." The task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate the following values:

- The total number of months included in the dataset.
- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.
- The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes.
- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
- The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

I have created a python script to analyze the data, and the results are saved as `result.txt` in the Analysis folder.

## PyPoll Challenge

In the PyPoll challenge, the dataset is focused on modernizing the vote-counting process for a rural U.S. town. The dataset, named `election_data.csv` (saved in the Resources folder), consists of three columns: "Voter ID," "County," and "Candidate." The task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates the following values:

- The total number of votes cast.
- A complete list of candidates who received votes.
- The percentage of votes each candidate won.
- The total number of votes each candidate won.
- The winner of the election based on popular vote.

I have created a python script to analyze the data, and the results are saved as `result.txt` in the Analysis folder.
